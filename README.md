# Daily Agenda (Material Desing for Bootstrap tutorial)

This is a small scheduling app built using [Material Design for Bootstrap (MDB)](https://mdbootstrap.com/), following their React tutorial.

The purpose of this exercise was to learn the MDB React library and improve my React skills. It was built in two stages (on two seperate branches);

- Using their template of React Class components
- Refactored to take advantage of React Hooks

## Build Setup (master branch)

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build Setup (refactor-to-use-hooks branch)

```bash
npm install

# Run development server using db.json as a fake REST API
npm run dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode using [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) as a fake REST API.

This is currently use for storing starter data, the database will not be updated with newly entered events.
